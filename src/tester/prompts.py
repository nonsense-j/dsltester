Given a code checker written in the DSL format, please generate comprehensive test cases (Java codes) for me.

### Explanations of DSL nodes and corresponding properties to better understand checkers in DSL formats
{node_properties}

## Notice: Must-follow guidelines
Here are detailed guildlines that you must always bear in mind and follow:
1. Test cases include both positive ones that will be reported by the checker and negative ones that pass the checker without issues.
2. Every test case should be able to pass compilation and keep minimal, excluding any code statements that are irrelevant to the checker.
3. Include simple, necessary comments to clarify the purpose of each test case and the label ("positive" or "negative").
4. Ensure that each case covering the same checking scenario only occurs once and that all possible scenarios are covered.
5. Test cases should be generally similar but vary in some specific code parts that reflect the differences of their checking scenarios.
6. Output test cases to me without detailed explanations and every test case must be independently surrounded with "```java" and "```".

## General Goal
Given a code checker written in the DSL format, please generate comprehensive and concise test cases (Java codes) that the checker can report. 

{additional_info}
## Important: Mandatory Guidelines for Test Case Generation
Strictly adhere to these rules when creating test cases:
1. Checker-Reportable Tests. Ensure every test case contains checker-matching code patterns to guarantee reportability. \
Never generate test cases that pass silentlyâ€”only those explicitly reported by the checker. Notely, prioritize checker requirements \
over rule descriptions (if provided), whwere the rule often describes suggested proper behaviors while the checker reports improper ones. \
2. Checking Scenario Coverage. Tests must cover all mandatory scenarios of the checker with minimal overlapping logic. Ensure no duplicate scenarios \
across test cases. Specifically, simplify regex variations (e.g., use 1-2 options from "(a|b|c|d)"). For each test case, add clear, \
targeted comments to highlight test purposes and distinctions between cases. 
3. Minimal Code Structure. Keep code simple, minimal, and free of irrelevant logic. Use basic statements (e.g., separate calls) rather than \
complex patterns (e.g., chained methods) unless explicitly required in the checker. Use unchecked exceptions (e.g., RuntimeException, NullPointerException) \
rather than checked ones (e.g., IOException) unless explicitly required in the checker.
4. Compilation Readiness. Guarantee 100%% compilability for every test case, which must be a complete Java file including necessary imports. \
Ensure to avoid implicit dependencies or external resource assumptions. Every symbol used in the code must be either defined within the \
test case itself or correctly imported. Do not import unused classes.
5. Standardized Test Code. Do not mention the test index in any comment in the test case. The test index should only occur in the main public class name, \
which uses exact class naming "PositiveTest{{i}}" where {{i}} is the test index.
6. Output Specification. Directly output each test case enclosed in separate "```java" and "```" blocks excluding detailed explanations.

## General Goal
Write mock Java classes for third-party libraries used in a project, based on provided code snippets. \
The mocks must replicate exact method signatures and field declarations referenced in the snippets, with minimum method bodies, default return \
and field values (e.g., null, 0, false, '', etc.). Prioritize using Object as argument/return/field types when possible to simplify dependencies. 

### Output Format
Directly Output the complete Java files (with correct pacakge declaration) for each mock library, each wrapped in "<lib-{{calss_fqn}}>" and \
"</lib-{{class_fqn}}>" without detailed explanations. {{class_fqn}} is the corresponding fully qualified class name of the mock library, e.g., \
output code of the class "com.example.AnotherClass" should be wrapped in "<lib-com.example.AnotherClass>" and "</lib-com.example.AnotherClass>".

You need to resolve these errors by modifying the Java files and the library code if necessary.

1. Fix Compilation Errors. Fix all compilation errors in the provided Java code files, while ignoring warnings. Since the error \
