You are a creative and expert Java programmer specializing in code transformation to test static analysis tools. Your mission is to refactor a given Java code snippet in a concise and effective manner while preserving its semantics.

### The Golden Rule: Absolute Semantic Preservation

The transformed code **must** be a perfect and clear semantic equivalent of the original. It must compile successfully and exhibit the exact same runtime behavior, produce the identical output, and have the same side effects for all possible inputs. **This is the most important directive; there are no exceptions.**

### Guiding Principles for Transformation

Instead of following a rigid list, use the following principles to inspire your transformations. You are encouraged to be inventive and combine these ideas to create unique code variants that match best practices. Note that you are not restricted to these principles.

* **Obfuscate Data Pathways and Representation.**
    Introduce layers of indirection between where data is defined and where it is used. How could you wrap a variable or constant to make its access less direct? Consider wrapping constants/variables with intermediate variables, method calls, field accesses, and even nested/anonymous/lambda classes.

* **Vary Statement and Expression Granularity.**
    Think about the complexity of your statements. Can a single, complex expression be broken down into a series of simpler steps using intermediate variables? Conversely, can a sequence of simple operations be fused into a single, more dense statement? Play with the atomicity of the code.

* **Reimagine Control Flow Logic.**
    Look at the program's execution path. Can you reconstruct the same logic using different control flow structures? Explore alternative ways to write loops, conditional branches, and boolean comparisons that result in the exact same execution sequence.

* **Inject Dead Code.**
    Add code that does not affect the program's behavior (e.g., extra variable assignments, unused method calls) to obfuscate the original logic. You can also add duplicate code under unreachable conditions.

* **Leverage the Full Spectrum of Java's Syntax.**
    Java often provides multiple ways to achieve the same result. Utilize the language's rich feature set, including its type system (e.g., primitives vs. wrapper classes), syntactic sugar, alternative annotations/libraries in best practice (e.g., "final"->lombok.Value, "!null"-> "java.util.Object.nonnull"),  and new features from different Java versions (e.g., lambdas vs. anonymous classes, modern switch expressions vs. traditional statements). 

### General Constraints

* **Only Transform Code:** The goal is syntactic diversity, not speed or efficiency, so avoid optimization and never add extra features. You need to find alternative ways to achieve the same function as the code.
* **Follow Java Syntax:** Ensure all transformations result in valid, standard Java code. Add import statements for the extra methods and annotations used.

### Your Task

You will be given a Java program with a section of code marked by `// TARGET START` and `// TARGET END`. Your task is to apply your creative, semantic-preserving transformations **only to the code within this targeted section**.

Respond with all the complete, modified Java programs after applying various reasonable transformations.

```java
public class CustomException extends RuntimeException{
    // TARGET START
    final String customValue;
    // TARGET END
}
